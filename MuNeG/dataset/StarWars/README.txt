I have to acknowledge the great job done by Evelina Gabasova (https://github.com/evelinag) who prepared the original data I included in this folder.
More specifically, I used the interactions between Star Wars characters listed in the files

    starwars-episode-N-interactions-allCharacters.json

that are publicly available here:

    https://github.com/evelinag/StarWars-social-network/blob/master/networks/

Those files include the interactions network with R2-D2 and Chewbacca added in using data from mentions network. 
See the Github repository for further information.

It is worth remarking that I relabeled all nodes to a unique set of integer IDs (StarWars_layout.txt), that DO NOT correspond to the ones in the original data.
